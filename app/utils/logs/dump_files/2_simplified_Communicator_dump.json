    "description": "Goal: Integrate Bugsnag into our video client to capture errors and automatically include environment context and user metadata for easier debugging. #### Requirements 1. Install & Configure Bugsnag - Add Bugsnag dependency to the video client. - Initialize Bugsnag with the correct project API key (configured from k8s-deploy/config.js). - Wrap the root React application with the Bugsnag error boundary. 2. Environment Detection - Ensure Bugsnag events include the correct environment name: - local (running locally on dev machines) - development (shared dev environment) - staging - production - Use existing environment variables/configuration to set this value dynamically. 3. User Metadata - Attach user context to every Bugsnag event: - Person ID — string or UUID identifying the logged-in user. - Account ID — identifier for the user’s account/organization. - Ensure this is updated on login/logout. 4. Testing - Simulate an error (e.g., throw inside a component) and verify in the Bugsnag dashboard that: - The correct environment is reflected. - Person ID and Account ID are reported. https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/react/ https://app.bugsnag.com/broadvoice-3/video-client/overview",

    "issuetype": "Story",
    "description": "## User story As a user, I want to see a clean view when I start a conversation through the search bar, so that I can have a less cluttered interface. ## Context We currently have two methods for starting conversations: one using the search bar and another using a newly added button (https://broadvoice-jira.atlassian.net/browse/CUU2-2776 + https://broadvoice-jira.atlassian.net/browse/CUU2-2895). When starting a conversation through the search bar, if no existing conversation with the selected contact is found, the contact's avatar, name, and phone number are displayed in the main conversation area, positioned above the message input field and send button. However, when creating group conversations with multiple participants, this results in a cluttered view, showcasing one avatar, name, and phone number for each user, which can be visually overwhelming and confusing, as shown in the following image. To enhance the user experience, we aim to synchronize both conversation creation methods, ensuring that the visual presentation and overall experience are cohesive. Implementing an empty state similar to the one used in the new conversation creation method, accessible via the dedicated button for conversations initiated through the search bar, will allow us to remove redundant contact details, such as avatars, names and phone numbers, from the conversation view. This change will result in a cleaner, more consistent, and easier-to-read interface, especially for group conversations. ## Acceptance criteria As is currently | As it should be :check_mark: Functional requirements FR1. Start a new conversation from the header - The user selects one or more contacts in the header's search - If there’s no existing conversation with the selected contact(s), a placeholder image and text are displayed - The conversation header is also displayed when creating a new conversation with a single contact (not in ad-hoc groups) - By sending a message or choosing to create a named group (through the modal), the conversation becomes effective, and the placeholder is replaced by the conversation body FR2. Existing conversation when adding people in the header - The user selects one or more contact in the header's search - If a prior conversation exists, it should be loaded in the main conversation area - If by adding or removing contacts, the conversation is considered new again, the placeholder mentioned in FR1 should be displayed FR3. Existing behavior to keep - Ad-hoc groups can only be created as external-only or internal-only - After selecting an external contact, internal contacts appear disabled - After selecting an internal contact, external contacts and unsaved numbers appear disabled - When more than 1 internal contact is added, the existing buttons to video call (if allowed) or create a named group should be displayed in the header’s search bar - If only 1 internal contact is selected, a button to start a voice call is also displayed 🛠️ Non-functional requirements NFR1. Layout - The position of the placeholder (combination of image and text) is relative to the chat footer with a distance of about 20% the chat area’s height - Note: This position is to be assessed and better defined during development through design follow-ups Assets: https://xd.adobe.com/view/4ba02f1a-8720-4278-ae02-32936d9a4767-1ef3/ ## Other information N/A",

The absence of visual indicators can cause frustration during message failures or delays. A similar feature exists for SMS. This proposal suggests implementing visual indicators for sent messages and offering users the option to resend messages if they fail. ## Acceptance criteria :check_mark: Functional requirements The following requirements apply only to conversations with directory (internal) contacts, either groups or 1:1. FR1. Sending an internal message - As the user hits send on an internal message, immediately display the new message bubble with the status “Sending” - The message input should be cleared - The status “Sending” will prevail until we can guarantee that it was successfully sent, or it returns an error - While in the “Sending” status, the user can’t long-tap to access more options FR2. Successfully sent internal message - Upon confirmation that the message was sent, the “Sending” status is replaced with the status “Sent” - The “Sent” status is only displayed in the latest message successfully sent by the user - It’s now possible to long-tap on a message to access all existing options FR3. Internal message fails to be sent - If the message fails to be sent, the “Sending” status is replaced with the “Failed to send” status, along with the retry option - This “Failed to send” status remains attached to each message that failed to be sent by the user - The user can delete or copy a message with the “Failed to send” status - The options to reply or pin shouldn’t be displayed on a message with the “Failed to send” status - If the latest message in a conversation is the one that failed, the message “Message failed to send” should be displayed as the preview of that conversation on the messages list FR4. Retry sending the message on fail - When the message is in the “Failed to send” status, a retry button is displayed along with it (“Tap to retry”) - When the user taps on this retry option: - The message returns to the bottom of the chat (position of the latest sent message) - The message now displays the “Sending” status, and bears the same limitations as on FR1 - The timestamp updates to correspond with the new attempt - Will follow the success or fail scenarios described in FR2 and FR3 :tools: Non-functional requirements NFR1. Usability and Interface - Each message status bears a different icon, according to the assets provided - Message statuses are displayed under the sent message bubble, aligned to the right of the bubble’s body (excluding the tip affordance) NFR2.

This can lead to delays, particularly on slow connections, making the system feel unresponsive. Additionally, users often have to retype their messages if they fail to send, which can result in frustration. To enhance user experience, we plan to introduce optimistic message sending on our web/ desktop platform. When a message is sent in an internal conversation (including both 1:1 chats and group conversations) it will be displayed instantly in the conversation with a temporary sending state. This state will then be updated to either a sent state or a failed state (with an option to retry), depending on the response received from the backend. ## Acceptance criteria :check_mark: Functional requirements The following requirements apply only to conversations with directory (internal) contacts, either groups or 1:1.

This becomes problematic when users have more than 100 conversations loaded: - It increases unnecessary network load. - It doesn’t provide additional value since we only care about the latest changes, and the polling request is ordered by latest message. - Messaging API/Scylla will throw when fetching more the 100 conversations at once. To optimize polling, we should restrict the limit to 30 conversations, which aligns with the default load behavior. Acceptance Criteria: - Conversation polling should always use 30 as the limit, regardless of how many are currently loaded. Testing Considerations: - Load fewer than 30 conversations and verify polling handles them correctly. - Load more than 30 (e.g., 100+) and confirm only 30 are polled. - Confirm that polling results still reflect the most recent conversation updates.",

The goal is to enhance the incoming call notification for users already on a call. ## Acceptance criteria - When a user is on an \"On call\" state (audio or video call) and receives a new audio call: - The incoming call should play the provided audio instead of the standard ringtone. - While ringing, the audio will play in 10-second intervals, until it is answered, declined, or the caller hangs up (e.g. audio plays once, wait 10 seconds, then play again. This pattern is repeated until the call stops ringing). - The user should receive a visual notification of the incoming call (UI popup remains unchanged). - When a user is not in an “On call”, or “Do not disturb” state, the incoming call should use the standard continuous ringtone. - This behavior should remain consistent across desktop and web platforms.

The backend will be updated to send real-time events when internal contacts are modified and deleted, allowing the frontend to receive updated information immediately. ## Acceptance criteria When a contact is edited, the updates should be immediately reflected, historically and going forward throughout the app, in the following interactions: - Internal contact - Conversation list (recent and unread) - 1:1 conversations (header, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - Named group conversation (members list, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - New conversation creation (in the unnamed section) - Call history (recent and missed) - Softphone interface (receiving and making calls, including adding or transferring calls) - Video call history - New video call creation - Voicemail list (unread and all) - Voicemail forward contact list - Contacts list (favorites and contacts, in the unnamed section) - Message notifications (in-app and push) - App call notifications - System call notifications - External contact - Conversation list (recent and unread) - 1:1 conversations (header, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - Ad-hoc group conversation (header, members list, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - New conversation creation (in the “Contacts” section) - Call history (recent and missed) - Softphone interface (receiving and making calls, including adding or transferring calls) - Voicemail list (unread and all) - Contacts list (favorites and contacts, in the “Contacts” section) - Message notifications (in-app and push) - App call notifications - System call notifications When a contact is deleted, the updates should be immediately reflected, historically and going forward throughout the app, in the following interactions: - Internal contact - Conversation list (recent and unread) - 1:1 conversations (header, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - Named group conversation (messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - External contact - Conversation list (recent and unread) - 1:1 conversations (header, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - Ad-hoc group conversation (header, members list, messages bubble, system messages, mentions) - Call history (recent and missed) - Voicemail list (unread and all) There is an issue reported by a client regarding voicemail sender names. When all users share the same CLID on their SIP accounts, the voicemail displays the name of the first user alphabetically in the location. Since the voicemail system does not have a personId in the endpoints, Android has always relied on the phone number for matching.At the moment, we are simply displaying the information provided by the backend without performing any additional matching. We have already created an investigation ticket to look into the current logic for displaying sender names across all platforms and to determine what changes are needed to correctly display the sender name in voicemails. ## Other information Users are able to easily locate new or existing contacts, through the following options: - Internal contacts - Messages tab (creating a new conversation or adding members to a named group conversation) - Calls tab - On call (transferring or adding calls) - Video tab (creating a new meeting, in the invite users section) - Contacts tab (in via search or scrolling to the contact by name, in the unnamed section) - Voicemail tab - External contacts - Messages tab (creating a 1:1 conversation) - Calls tab - Voicemail tab - Contacts tab (via search or scrolling to the contact by name, in the \"My contacts\" section)",
