You are drafting the "Overview" bullet list for the Release Notes.

Context JSON (summarized issues; Internals are excluded):
{issues_json}

Goal:
- Produce a short list of high-level, user-facing themes capturing what changed.
- Cluster issues into 3–5 generic themes by product area or capability.
- Prefer merged bullets for adjacent areas when appropriate.

Constraints:
- Return ONLY a Markdown bullet list, one bullet per line, no numbering.
- At most {max_points} bullets.
- Each bullet is a short noun phrase (<= 7–10 words), may omit a verb, end with a period.
- Do NOT include section headers or any commentary.
- Do NOT include issue keys or codes.
- Do NOT output bare generic labels like "Bug fixes" or "Enhancements".
  Only use generic terms when qualified by a concrete area, e.g.:
  "Bug fixes in webchat.", "Improvements to conversation management.", "Stability improvements for video calls."

Theming guidance:
- Group issues by product area, capability, or surface (e.g., conversation management, video calls, webchat, notifications).
- Merge closely related areas into a single bullet when helpful.
- Avoid metrics, counts, or implementation details; emphasize the area impacted.

Style examples (format only, not content):
- Enhancement conversation list sorting
- Bug fix for group conversation archiving
- Improved conversation list loading after login
- Bug fix for voicemail sender name display
- Performance improvements for SMS processing
- Bug fix for archived conversation participation status

Output:
Return only the bullet list. No additional text.
