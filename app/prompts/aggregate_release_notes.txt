You are creating the final Markdown release notes from summarized issues.

Sections JSON:
{sections_json}

Instructions:
- Compose a clean Markdown document.
- Header: add a top-level title like "Release Notes". If a version/date is present in the data, include it.
- After the header, add a single line with today's date in the format "{today}".
- Immediately after the date, insert the following Introduction section verbatim (do not alter its content or spacing):
-
{introduction_section}
-
- Sectioning: Render the following sections in this exact order and with these exact names, including only non-empty sections:
  1) New features
  2) Enhancements
  3) Bug fixes
  4) Internals
  For each section, render a second-level heading (## {Section}).
- Items (no bullets): For each item, output two lines with a blank line after each item:
  1) "[{key}] **{title}**"
  2) "      {blurb}" (start with at least 6 spaces to visually indent)
- Links: when a key looks like ABC-123, leave it as plain text (linking will be injected later).
- Include only sections with at least one item.
- Tone: professional, concise, user-focused.

Output:
Return only the Markdown body. No additional commentary.
