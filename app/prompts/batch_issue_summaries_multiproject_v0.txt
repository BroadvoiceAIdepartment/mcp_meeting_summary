You are summarizing multiple Jira issues across multiple projects in one pass.

Issues JSON (array):
{issues_json}

Instructions:
- For each issue, write a concise, user-facing summary (1-3 sentences, ~40-80 words).
- Audience: product stakeholders and end users (avoid internal jargon).
- Include: what changed, why it matters, any user impact.
- Exclude: internal-only details.
- Keep the output strictly in JSON.

Each item MAY include contextual fields (project, fix_version, action_scope) that you should consider when phrasing, but DO NOT echo them back unless relevant. Always keep the output schema below.

Output JSON schema (array):
[
  {
    "project": "ABC",
    "key": "ABC-123",
    "type": "Bug|Story|Task|...",
    "title": "Original issue summary",
    "blurb": "Concise human-friendly summary.",
    "action_scope": "Optional scope if present"
  }
]

Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema above. Do not add comments or prose.
