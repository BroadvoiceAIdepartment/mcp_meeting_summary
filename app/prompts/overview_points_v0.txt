You are drafting the "Overview" bullet list for the Release Notes.

Context JSON (summarized issues; Internals are excluded):
{issues_json}

Goal:
- Produce a short list of concrete, user-facing bullets capturing key aspects of this release.
- Focus on improved client experiences, meaningful enhancements, and impactful bug fixes.
- Be specific; avoid vague language. Prefer action and user value.
- Do not echo or list category names (e.g., "Bug", "Story", "Task"). Instead, summarize the concrete outcome.

Constraints:
- Return ONLY a Markdown bullet list, one bullet per line, no numbering.
- At most {max_points} bullets.
- Each bullet should be a single sentence (<= 25 words), no trailing punctuation beyond a period.
- Do NOT include section headers or any commentary.
- Do NOT include issue keys or codes; summarize the outcome plainly.
- Do NOT output generic labels like "Bug fixes", "Enhancements", or issuetype names.

Style examples (format only, not content):
- Reduced message delivery delays during peak usage for enterprise clients.
- Simplified onboarding flow, cutting setup time for new users.
- Fixed intermittent crash when attaching large files in conversations.

Output:
Return only the bullet list. No additional text.
